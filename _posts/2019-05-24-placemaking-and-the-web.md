I&#8217;ve always felt that deep down I&#8217;m not a technology person&#8211;I&#8217;m a community person. And it just so happens that throughout my life I&#8217;ve happened to find an abundance of community through technology. But overall I&#8217;m much more interested in building community.

Over the last couple of months, I&#8217;ve been thinking more about what lessons can be learned from community planning, which of these lessons translates to the online world, and which ones need to be expanded/adapted. This post isn&#8217;t here to flesh ideas but rather it&#8217;s to draw a line in the sand about something I want to explore more closely over a (hopefully) extended amount of time.

> ### How do we* make place in online learning?

*also, who makes up the &#8220;we&#8221; and who shapes who makes up the &#8220;we&#8221;. But that&#8217;s another story for another time.

It feels like there has been a lot of conversation post-Election about civility online. About how we recommit to constructive conversation. I was reminded of this from a recent episode of On Being where Krista Tippett talked about her new project: [Civil Conversations Projects][1].

There&#8217;s a similar narrative in urban planning and design: We built to scale and not towards human-to-human interaction. I&#8217;m curious about what the web world can learn from the development of placemaking movement.

>   As both an overarching idea and a hands-on approach for improving a neighborhood, city, or region, Placemaking inspires people to collectively reimagine and reinvent public spaces as the heart of every community. Strengthening the connection between people and the places they share, Placemaking refers to a collaborative process by which we can shape our public realm in order to maximize shared value. More than just promoting better urban design, Placemaking facilitates creative patterns of use, paying particular attention to the physical, cultural, and social identities that define a place and support its ongoing evolution.

  Today on campus at OU we are hosted our third Placemaking Conference and one of the speakers was Fred Kent, the Founder and President of Project for Public Spaces, who wrote a book called How to Turn a Place Around.  The book lists the following eleven principles for creating great community places:



  
    THE COMMUNITY IS THE EXPERT
  
  
    CREATE A PLACE, NOT A DESIGN
  
  
    LOOK FOR PARTNERS
  
  
    YOU CAN SEE A LOT JUST BY OBSERVING
  
  
    HAVE A VISION
  
  
    START WITH THE PETUNIAS: LIGHTER, QUICKER, CHEAPER
  
  
    TRIANGULATE
  
  
    THEY ALWAYS SAY “IT CAN’T BE DONE”
  
  
    FORM SUPPORTS FUNCTION
  
  
    MONEY IS NOT THE ISSUE
  
  
    YOU ARE NEVER FINISHED
  


You can read extended definitions of the 11 steps [here][2]. Again, I have little to say at the moment but I&#8217;m more and more curious about principles for designing online spaces, educational or not, in a collaborative fashion for communities with specific sociocultural contexts and believe these principles could be useful if taken with the right balance of open mindeness and skeptism. Please share if you are aware of folks that are doing research into similar ideas.
